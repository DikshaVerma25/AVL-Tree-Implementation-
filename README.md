# AVL-Tree-Implementation-

AVL tree is a self-balancing Binary Search Tree (BST) where the difference
between heights of left and right subtrees cannot be more than one for all
nodes. In this project, you’re asked to develop and test a small AVL Tree (i.e.
the entire tree resides in main memory). The data is given in the form (key)
with no duplicates, you are required to implement an AVL Tree to store the key
values. Your implementation should support the following operations:
1. Initialize (): create a new AVL tree
2. Insert (key)
3. Delete (key)
4. Search (key): returns the key if present in the tree else NULL
5. Search (key1, key2): returns keys that are in the range key1 ≤key ≤key2
